# Machine Learning Classification Project

This project demonstrates the use of multiple machine learning models to classify data. The goal is to compare the performance of different classifiers using a dataset and visualize their performance using confusion matrices.

## Project Overview

In this project, multiple classification models are applied to a dataset to predict a target variable. The models included are:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The performance of each model is evaluated using confusion matrices, and the results are visualized using `matplotlib`.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:
- `python==3.12`
- `PyCharm Community Edition 2024.1`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas numpy scikit-learn
